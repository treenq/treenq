# treenq

An open-source Platform as Code for Kubernetes to simplify app delivery, cloud resource provisioning, and infrastructure management.

## Demo

TBD

# Treenq

> ### 🚧 **Pre-Alpha Notice**: _The project is in pre-alpha stage, the alpha test planned in_ **2025 Q2**

Treenq is a Platform as a Service (as Code) solves the infrastructure and App Delivery complexity in Kubernetes.

Early-stage teams need:

- 🚀 **Fast & affordable CI/CD** – Build and deploy apps without complex pipelines.
- 🛠 **Database & cloud resources** – Provision services seamlessly.
- 🔐 **Secure secrets & configurations** – Manage credentials and settings effortlessly.
- ⚡ **Instant previews** – Get early feedback with temporary environments.

Treenq solves this problem.

And finally you can install an open source platform and use it for free in order to get:

- 🚀 **App Delivery** – Deploy from Dockerfile/Containerfile or build & run commands.
- 🌍 **Custom Domains** – Instantly get a third-level domain for your app.
- 🗄️ **Database Provisioning** – Securely provision and inject database credentials.
- ⚖️ **Optimized Resource Allocation** – Use minimal cloud resources efficiently.

And many more planned Features:

- 🏗 **Environment Management** – Easily configure dev, staging, and production.
- 📊 **API-Level Metrics & Alerts** – Track and optimize performance.
- 🔄 **Local-to-Cloud Deployment** – Push from your machine to test environments.
- 🔧 **Per-Environment Config Export** – Get configuration files to run apps locally.

## Motivation

Most PaaS solutions are closed-source, costly, and lock you into their ecosystem.
Treenq offers a fully open-source alternative, giving you full control over your app management and infrastructure.

Treenq is designed to prioritize Application Management over infrastructure concerns. While it provides helpful constraints, self-hosting allows full access to your Kubernetes cluster.

Many teams end up building complex **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)**.
Treenq isn’t meant to replace IDPs but to offer **fast, streamlined app delivery**, letting engineers focus on shipping code.

We welcome all contributions! Before submitting code, please open an issue to discuss your changes.

### How to run

- Install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Install Docker/Colima/Podman for running dev environment
- Mac users only: install macFUSE: `brew install macfuse`
- Run the dev environment: `docker compose up`
- Run `go run cmd/server/main.go`

#### Run e2e tests

Running a dev container locally for e2e tests require additional security options.
This tip will also help to run the service inside a container.

###### Option 1: podman

`podman run --device /dev/fuse:rw localhost/treenq`

###### Option 2: docker/colima

Docker is able running only a privileged container:
`docker run --privileged  -it treenq`
